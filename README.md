## ðŸ“œ Overview

MLHelpers is designed to alleviate common challenges faced during the machine learning process. By offering a comprehensive set of functions and tools, this repository aims to become an invaluable companion for ML practitioners, aiding in both experimentation and deployment phases.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Classification_Results**: A function dedicated to providing a granular classification report. Accepts ground truth values (`y_true`) and predicted probabilities (`y_preds`) as input and furnishes detailed metrics.

  **Parameters**:
  - `--target_value`: Determines the target specificity or sensitivity. (Default: 0.9)
    - Example: `--target_value 0.85` aims for a specificity or sensitivity of 0.85.
  - `--sen`: If provided, `target_value` denotes the target sensitivity; if not, it represents specificity.
    - Example: Using `--sen` will treat `target_value` as sensitivity.
  - `--youden_index`: If included, the optimal threshold is ascertained using Youden's Index, maximizing the balance between sensitivity and specificity.
  - `--display_cm`: When set, outputs the confusion matrix to the console.

## ðŸš€ Usage

To evaluate the performance of a model on synthetic binary classification data, utilize the command below. It allows for various configurations to cater to specific testing needs:

```bash
python main.py --n <samples_per_class> --target_value <target_value> --sen --youden_index --display_cm
```
  - `--n`: Specifies the number of samples for each class. (Default: 500) 
    - Example: `--n 1000` will generate 1000 samples for both positive and negative classes.

The provided command-line interface offers flexibility, ensuring that users can replicate different real-world scenarios and understand model dynamics with ease.
